Brick Map Theme
===============

USA road map using OSM data, including:
- MapBox project files which allows change color-theme easily
- SQL for create render tables
- Patched mapnik XML themes
- Mason configuration file
- Resources

These are not included:
- Shapefiles (Most of them come from NaturalEarth project)
- Scripts for pre-pressing label placements

Borrowed ideas from Highroad and OSMBright project.
